## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### **Form Field Detection**
The extension uses intelligent selectors to detect common form fields:

```javascript
const commonFieldMappings = {
  'first name': ['input[name*="first"]', 'input[id*="first"]', 'input[placeholder*="first"]'],
  'email': ['input[type="email"]', 'input[name*="email"]', 'input[id*="email"]'],
  'phone': ['input[type="tel"]', 'input[name*="phone"]', 'input[id*="phone"]'],
  // ... more mappings
};
```

### **Form Filling Logic**
Based on the browser-use pattern, the extension:

1. **Detects form fields** using multiple selector strategies
2. **Maps fields** to user profile data
3. **Fills fields sequentially** with appropriate delays
4. **Handles different input types** (text, select, radio, checkbox)
5. **Provides user feedback** throughout the process

### **Data Structure**
User profile data is structured as:

```javascript
{
  personalInfo: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    phone: "555-555-5555",
    address: "123 Main St",
    city: "Rochester",
    state: "NY",
    postalCode: "12345",
    country: "USA",
    age: "25",
    gender: "Male",
    race: "Asian",
    veteranStatus: "Not a veteran",
    disabilityStatus: "No disability"
  },
  professionalInfo: {
    experience: "2-3 years",
    skills: ["JavaScript", "Python", "React"],
    education: "BS Computer Science, University of Rochester",
    certifications: ["AWS Certified", "PMP"],
    workAuthorization: true,
    sponsorshipNeeded: false,
    professionalLicense: false
  },
  resume: {
    fileName: "john_doe_resume.pdf",

  }
}
```

## üé® Customization

### **Adding New Field Mappings**
Edit `resume-filler.js` to add new field detection patterns:

```javascript
const commonFieldMappings = {
  'custom_field': ['input[name*="custom"]', 'input[id*="custom"]'],
  // Add your custom mappings here
};
```

### **Modifying Form Filling Logic**
Update the `fillForm()` method to customize the filling process:

```javascript
async fillForm() {
  // Add your custom logic here
  await this.fillPersonalInfo();
  await this.fillCustomFields(); // Your custom method
  // ... rest of the process
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **Fields not detected**
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Check if the form is fully loaded
   - Some forms load dynamically

2. **Fields not filled**
   - Verify your profile is complete
   - Check if field names match expected patterns
   - Some fields might be read-only

3. **File upload not working**
   - File uploads require manual user interaction
   - Click the file upload field manually
   - Select your resume file

### **Debug Mode**
Open browser console to see detailed logging:
```javascript
// Check if extension is loaded
console.log(window.resumeFiller);

// Check detected fields
window.resumeFiller.formFields;

// Check user data
window.resumeFiller.userData;
```

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- **Multi-language support** for international applications
- **Template system** for different job types
- **Integration with job boards** (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.)
- **Resume parsing** to auto-extract information
- **Cover letter generation** based on job descriptions
